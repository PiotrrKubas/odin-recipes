# odin-recipes
Odin recipes is the first project in The Oding Projects. It's main goal is to give student an opportunity to get used with working hmtl and git. This project also gave a chance to learning proper filer structure. 

Requirements were quite easy, which I think is a good idea for the first project. It can show student the joy of creating something with code.
